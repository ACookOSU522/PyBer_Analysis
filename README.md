# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of data to showcase the relationship between driver, city, and fare for affordability. :red_car:

### Reviewing PyBer ride-share data to create a DataFrame that highlights the basic fare and driver data by city type.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_Data.csv
- Software: Anaconda 4.13.10, Pandas 1.3.5, Matplotlib


## Results: :blue_car: 
The major differences between ride-sharing in each city type is the higher the availabilty of drivers to provide rides equls the lower cost per ride, However it also makes the pay for each driver less due to competition.

* Rural areas provide the lowest total rides at 125 rides, spread among 78 drivers.  The total fares earned is $4,327.93, with the average ride fare at $32.62, and average fare per driver is $55.49.
* Suburban areas provide a mid-range total rides at 625 rides, spread among 490 drivers.  The total fares earned is $19,356.33, with the average ride fare at $30.97, and average fare per driver is $39.50.
* Urban areas provide the highest number of total rides at 1,625 rides, with 2,405 drivers available this is stiff competition for drivers.  The total fares earned is $39,854.38, with the average ride fare at $24.53, and average fare per driver is $16.57.

## Summary: 
Based on the data analysis results from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019, I recommend the below items for consideration for optimal business performance in each city type.

* Staffing increases in all 3 city types in mid-February to meet the demand for higher ride requests,possibly due to springtime soggy-weather:umbrella:; results indicate the cost per driver will balance out with a higher average fare/driver ratio.
* Urban areas see increasingly cyclical peaks and valleys along a relatively steady line after the mid_February peak, but there is a leveling out in April before a noted decline in rides.
* Additional data review indicates a very sharp drop in rides in all 3 city types in May; preliminary guess on decline is due to increased pleasant :sunny: weather and more riders prefer other travel methods such as walking.
